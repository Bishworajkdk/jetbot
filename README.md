# Jetbot - Final Year College Project

**Overview:**

This repository showcases the culmination of my final year college project. The project involved training a Jetbot using a machine learning framework to replicate self-driving capabilities on a pre-designed track that we built. The primary goal was to implement and test the functionality of the Jetbot in a controlled environment.

**Project Highlights:**

- **Technology Stack:**
  - TensorFlow for machine learning.
  - PyTorch for additional functionalities.
  - Jupyter Lab for interactive development.

- **Methodology:**
  - Trained the Jetbot using machine learning models.
  - Implemented the self-driving capabilities on a pre-designed track.
  - Tested and validated the Jetbot's performance.

**Project Success:**

The project went through various stages of development, from setting up the necessary frameworks to designing and building the track for testing. The Jetbot successfully demonstrated self-driving capabilities on the track, showcasing the practical application of machine learning in robotics.

Feel free to explore the project, review the code, and reach out for any questions or collaborations.

*Note: This project was part of my final year studies and serves as a testament to the successful application of machine learning in robotics.*
